# Crop_Yield
This project showcases KPIs in Crop Yield Analysis. It is used practice my Data Analysis skills using SQL, Excel, and PowerBi.

The KPIs are the following:
1.Total Production per Year
2.Average Yield Crop per Year
3.Top 5 Crops by Total Production
4.Yield per State

In Excel I included Pivot Tables' Total Production and Yield Trends that shows the yield through each season.

In PowerBi I added LineCharts about Total Production Trend by Year, Average Yield vs Rainfall Over Years. I added a Bar Chart about Top Crops by Production. And I added a scatter plot, Fertilizer vs. Yield.
